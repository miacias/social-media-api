# Social Media API

## Description

Social media applications house TONS of data, and with so many users in one place, there are many interesting metrics to track. An API for such a site would prove as an invaluable window into these details. And as a standard for any social media site, it is necessary to have a back-end that houses and manages this data. 

This API project imitates what data management would be like for a social media service for its users, their thoughts, and reactions. This particular project uses NoSQL, which was a refreshing change from the rigid MySQL tables and columns. I learned the magic of managing MongoDB documents via Mongoose and the ease of simply updating a parent docuement as needed.

## Installation
  
Clone the repo do a local machine. With Node already installed, type into the terminal `npm i` to install the node packages: express and mongoose. Finally, type the terminal command `npm start` to start the server locally.


## Usage

Once the server is running, open an API client of choice, such as Postman or Insomnia to interact with the data. It may be beneficial to reference the routes JS files for which routes are available. Send C.R.U.D. operations to the server to get started.
